# NERIC_2019

This repository provides the abstract, poster, references, and code used to support my abstract titled, "Consumer data and risk stratification for Coronary Heart Disease." This abstract was presented at the 2019 North East Regional IDeA conference following the aesthetic recommendations of the #betterposter movement. Additional information on the #betterposter movement can be found here: https://osf.io/ef53g/  

This abstract is part of a larger project. Access to the full repository is avaiable upon request.
